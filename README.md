# pytorch-flash

## Goal

This is an experimental project to realize:

* fast implementations and experiments on Deep Learning projects
* simple codes to understand and maintain with ease
	* unified DL interfaces as possible

* less effort and complex, more productive and flexible

## Description

* deep learning implementations wrapper based on pytorch and pytorch-ignite
* unofficial private project ( unrelated to the pytorch developer teams )

Caution:

This is experimental and there occur unexpected behaviour. Please notice me them !

## How To

To appear ...

## Schedule

* v0.0 alpha : November, 2019
	+ add several functions
	+ unify iterfaces as possible
	+ several tests and debugs
	+ make examples

## Future Works

* automatic flow generation

* efficient debug functions
	+ based on tensorwatch ?

* parallel compuations
	+ data parallel
	+ multi GPUs

* other DL framework backends, in particular, chainer

* connection to model deployments
